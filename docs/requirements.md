# Requirements

The following section lists all the project requirements that have been identified during the analysis phase for the **Test 2 Code with LLMs (T2C)** project.

## Business Requirements

1. Test2Code shall provide working code implementations that adhere to the given test specifications.
1. Test2Code shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating AI-powered code generation into CI/CD pipelines for automated development workflows.
1. Test2Code shall experiment with multiple LLMs to evaluate and compare their performance on code generation tasks, providing empirical evidence for model selection.
1. Test2Code shall serve as a proof-of-concept for shifting developer roles from code writers to test specification providers.

## Domain Requirements

### Code Generation Domain

1. The system shall generate syntactically valid code in the target programming language(s) based on provided test specifications.
1. Generated code shall pass all provided test cases without modification, ensuring functional correctness.
1. The system shall support multiple types of test inputs:
   - Unit tests (testing individual functions/methods)
   - Integration tests (testing component interactions)
   - Acceptance tests (testing user-facing behavior)
1. The system shall handle increasingly complex software projects as case studies:
   - Simple games ([Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe))
   - Moderate complexity ([Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four))
   - Higher complexity ([2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)))

### Large Language Model Domain

1. The system shall interface with multiple LLM providers:
   - Open-source models (Mistral, DeepSeek R1, Smollm2, Qwen3, Llama3)
   - Commercial APIs (Gemini Flash)
1. The system shall implement proper prompt engineering techniques to optimize code generation quality from test specifications.
1. The system shall handle LLM API rate limits and failure scenarios gracefully.
1. Generated code quality shall be measurable and comparable across different LLM models.

### Testing Domain

1. The system shall parse and understand various test frameworks and assertion patterns.
1. Test specifications shall provide sufficient context for the LLM to understand:
   - Expected function signatures
   - Input/output relationships
   - Business logic requirements
   - Edge case handling
1. The system shall validate that generated code passes the original test suite through automated execution.

### CI/CD Integration Domain

1. The system shall be packageable as a command-line tool suitable for CI/CD pipeline integration.
1. The system shall support configurable retry mechanisms when initial code generation attempts fail tests.
1. The system shall provide detailed logging and reporting for pipeline integration and debugging.
1. The system shall handle version control workflows, including:
   - Reading tests from feature branches
   - Generating code to designated output directories
   - Integration with pull request workflows

### Research Domain

1. The system shall collect metrics on code generation success rates across different:
   - Test types (unit, integration, acceptance)
   - Project complexity levels
   - LLM models
1. The system shall enable reproducible experiments with consistent test cases across different model evaluations.
1. Generated code quality shall be evaluated using multiple criteria:
   - Test pass rates
   - Code complexity metrics
   - Performance characteristics

## Functional Requirements

### User Functional Requirements

1. Users shall provide a directory of test files to generate corresponding implementation code.
1. Users shall specify the target output directory for generated code.
1. Users shall select which LLM model to use for code generation.
1. Users shall run comparative experiments across multiple models with identical test inputs.
1. Users shall integrate the tool into automated pipelines with appropriate exit codes and logging.

### System Functional Requirements

1. The system shall execute generated code against the original test suite to validate correctness.
1. The system shall implement retry logic with iterative refinement when tests fail.
1. The system shall generate comprehensive reports on generation success/failure rates.
1. The system shall support batch processing of multiple test files simultaneously.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system shall generate code for simple test cases (< 10 tests) within 2 minutes per LLM model.
1. The system shall handle network failures and API timeouts gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms.
1. The system architecture shall allow easy addition of new LLM providers.
1. API keys and credentials shall be stored securely and not logged or exposed.

## Implementation Requirements

1. The system shall be implemented in Python 3.11+ for broad compatibility and rich ecosystem support.
1. The system shall implement a plugin architecture for easy addition of new LLM providers.
