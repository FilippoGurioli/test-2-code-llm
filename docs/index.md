# Project documentation for the ASMD course

This is the project documentation for the Advanced Software Modeling and Design course at the University of Bologna. The project focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in software development, providing as input many different test files from which the model should be able to understand the context and provide useful suggestions and code snippets.
