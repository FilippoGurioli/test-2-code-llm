# Introduction

Test 2 Code with LLMs (T2C) is a project that explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating code from various types of tests, including Unit, Integration, and Acceptance tests. The goal is to evaluate how effectively LLMs can understand the context provided by these tests and produce accurate and functional code implementations.

The idea is that, passing a directory that contains all the tests, T2C should be able to understand the context and generate code that satisfies the requirements defined by the tests.

The project aims to demonstrate how the role of a software developer can be shifted towards more of a test provider, with the LLM handling the code generation based on those tests.
